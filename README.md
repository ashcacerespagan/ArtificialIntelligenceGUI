# ArtificialIntelligenceGUI

I created this project as a creative interface mockup that explores what an AI assistant GUI might look like. While the functionality is rule-based rather than truly intelligent, it let me focus on delivering a futuristic and clean user interface, combining theme consistency with conditional logic. This helped me practice scene switching, input handling, and custom styling within JavaFX.
